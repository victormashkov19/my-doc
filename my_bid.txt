####### Image processing ######################################
Dear Sir.
Thanks for your post.
Until now, I have done many tasks, variable game projects such as casino Games, artificial intelligence, image and video processing, variable server construction, mobile projects, web home-page construction, different design task and so on. 
For example, I developed detection, recognition and classification projects such as variable OCR projects, OMR, NLP, plate information recognition, facial recognition, invoice detection and recognition, variable counting object projects, measure project using image processing and so on.Also, I usual using many technique and library, frameworks such as tensorflow, tesseract, machine learning such as CNN, DNN, FCRN, SVN etc. and I am generally not attached to programming language in working.(C++, C#, Linux, Python, Java, Android, RasPi ....)I have a ability able to finish your project wonderfully in a short time, and if want, I can send previous demo that developed before asap.I place my highest priority on the quality of my creation before anything else.If you reply my bidding, I will show you my ability and if you want to work with me I will do my best to fulfill your task.I hope that we can work together to gain better fruits.I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Thank you.

################ speaker recognition ###########################

Hello sir.
Thanks for your job posting!
I am a speech AI expert with enriched experience 3+ years.
Your Project caught my eye because of the unique challenge it offers. I particularly liked Speaker & Speech recognition, which aligns with my work values and goals.
Did you know that the speaker emmbeding(x-vector) based on DNN is the best speaker recognition direction?
I have already developed a dedicated Speaker recognition engine based on xVector+CNN+LSTM+StatisticPooling.
Probably you will be not to able to search the open code about this tech from internet since I don't distribute this one.
What I want to know, How many dataset(corpus) can you provide and how about the acoustic environment(SNR)?
I have plenty of ability to carry out my work with high quality in time.
I hope you to contact with me for more detail discussing.
Thank you.
