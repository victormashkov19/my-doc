 We will later today come up with some images of motors without labels, and see what it says
 
 All the new ones are in the test rig. 
 The test rig is still a prototype, but camera and motor are fixed in their final (ish) positions. 
 Bottom line, what the camera sees is the same.  
 The first two files, are not, that just from my office table. 
 So there should not be much variation any more. 
 The capture process is still manual, but that will be integrated in the test rig software (Build in LabView) 
 ..including your app, so LabView will call the python code. 
 Something like this:
C:\>python app_1.0.py
 MIS17_Q 
 ...we can send some arguments. 
 The app.py
 should run in a loop, like:
'P' Process image
'Q' Quit
..and output
{ JSON bla bla} 
 So it process an image lets say '1.jpg' every time. Our camera capture program will save 1 image in the app_1.0.py
 folder, with the filename '1.jpg'

 I hope it makes sense.
